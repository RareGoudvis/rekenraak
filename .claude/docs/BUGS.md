# Bugs & known gaps — backlog for a later pass

Found but deliberately **not fixed** in the pass that found them. One line each: where, what,
how to reproduce, and (if known) the fix direction. Remove the line when fixed and log the fix
in [UpdateState.md](UpdateState.md). Agents: append here, never fix silently.

## Oefenmodus (first classroom test, 2026-10-09)





- Kiosk verbanden-paren ("Getallenkennis › Omzettingen"): the owner's preview (2026-10-10) showed no exercise; NOT
  reproduced on 3851873 (gallery, the full builder path, 160 setting combos, 5 viewports all render; paren became
  interactive in f2a4782, so an older preview build is the suspect). Needs the owner's device + link. 2026-10-11
  preview). Suspect: the row dies in the pre-flight / `nextExercise` returns null at the builder defaults.
  Reproduce via a single-row session; see the kiosk-gallery `gen-fail` flag. 2026-10-10

## Oefenmodus beta audit 2026-10-09

External beta audit against 5c93876, every line re-verified on 4c51ef2 (evidence under
~/Downloads/oefen-check/audit/{1,2,3}/). Plan: ~/.claude/plans/oefen-audit-fixes.md. Lines are
grouped per work package so parallel deletions merge cleanly; fixed lines are deleted, O16 stays by owner decision (O7 closed as log-only, REVIEW §D).
